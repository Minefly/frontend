## What is Minefly?

Minefly is a currently unreleased server hosting software with a goal of providing free, community first minecraft servers. Not only do we allow people to create free servers in less than a second, but we also link our servers together, allow you to kickstart your community.

## Filing a Bug Report or Feature Request

You can file a bug report or feature request on our [meta server](https://discord.gg/jFKUfAeVGQ), or open one here. We label feature requests and bug reports as "issues". You can create one [here](https://github.com/Minefly/frontend/issues/new/choose).
