Minefly Frontend
</h1>

Welcome to the Minefly Frontend repository (the code for our website). We use a combination of [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to power our website. Join our meta discord where we discuss planned features and other Minefly content [here](https://discord.gg/jFKUfAeVGQ).

## What is Minefly?

Minefly is a currently unreleased server hosting software to provide free, community-first Minecraft servers. Not only do we allow people to create free servers in less than a second, but we also link our servers together, allow you to kickstart your community.

## Filing a Bug Report or Feature Request

You can file a bug report or feature request on our [meta server](https://discord.gg/jFKUfAeVGQ), or open one here. We label feature requests and bug reports as "issues". You can create one [here](https://github.com/Minefly/frontend/issues/new/choose).

 2. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and a code editor (I recommend [VSC (Visual Code Studio)](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
 3. In GitHub desktop, clone the repository to your computer, and then open it in your code editor

Select your repo (should be like \<yourname>/frontend) and hit clone!

#### Step Two: Setting up a Live Workspace

1. Download [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
2. Launch Nodejs (should look something like windows terminal)
3. Send `yarn` in nodejs, then feel free to close the window after it does its thing
4. Open the VSC terminal. This can be done by pressing Ctrl + Shift + \`. If you can't use keybinds for some reason, right click on the project, click "Open command Prompt" and copy this into the searchbar `Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal (In Active Workspace)`. Click the first (and only) result.
5. Type `yarn dev` into the terminal, and it should look like below (this may take a while!)
